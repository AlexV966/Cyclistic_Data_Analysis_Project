# Cyclistic Bike-Sharing Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This repository contains the analysis of Cyclistic's Q1 2019 bike-sharing trip data, focusing on understanding usage patterns between member and casual riders.

## Repository Contents
- `Cyclistic_Divvy_Trips_2019_Q1.csv`: Processed dataset with cleaned and transformed data
- `Cyclistic usage patterns across Member and Casual riders.pdf`: Exported slides presentation of findings

## Data Analysis Overview
This project analyzes Cyclistic's Q1 2019 bike-sharing data, with a focus on:
- Trip duration patterns and outliers
- Station preferences by user type
- Temporal usage patterns
- Variance in travel times between member and casual riders

## Data Cleaning Methodology
The dataset was cleaned and prepared with the following steps:
1. Removed duplicates and blanks in critical columns
2. Eliminated irrelevant data (latitude/longitude, gender, birth year)
3. Implemented quality control measures:
   - Removed trips longer than 6 hours (likely technical errors)
   - Cleaned and standardized column names
   - Re-arranged columns for better readability

## Key Findings
- Significant differences in trip duration between user types
- Distinct station preferences by day of week
- Varied usage patterns between members and casual riders

## Usage
The cleaned dataset and analysis can be used for:
- Understanding bike-sharing usage patterns
- Identifying peak usage times
- Analyzing station demand
- Comparing member vs casual rider behavior

## Data Structure
- Day of week represented numerically (1-7 for Sun-Mon)
- Separate visualizations for members and casual riders
- Cleaned trip duration data for accurate analysis
