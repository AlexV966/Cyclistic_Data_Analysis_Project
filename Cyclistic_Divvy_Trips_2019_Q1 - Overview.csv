Bike-Sharing Dataset Overview

Dataset Source:
- Cyclistic's Q1 2019 trip data

Dataset Preparation:
- Imported into Google Sheets for analysis
- Cleaned and processed to ensure data quality and relevance

Data Cleaning & Preparation:
1. Trip Data:
- Created and calculated trip duration column
- Removed duplicates and blanks in critical trip ID column
- Removed latitude/longitude data (irrelevant for analysis)
- Removed gender and birth year columns (privacy concerns and especially high null values)
- Removed specific bike ID column (not relevant for analysis)
- Re-arranged columns for better readability

2. Quality Control:
- Implemented outlier detection
- Found significant differences in trip durations between member and casual riders
- Identified and removed trips longer than 6 hours (likely due to technical issues)
- Average trip duration:
* Members: ~11 minutes
* Casual riders: ~1.6 hours (before outlier removal)

3. Advanced Analysis:
- Calculated variance of travel times between Member and Casual Riders
- Analyzed preferred start and end docking stations by user type
- Conducted day-of-week analysis of station preferences (1-7 for Sun-Mon)

4. Data Structure:
- Separate visualizations for members and casual riders due to volume differences
- Day of week represented numerically (1-7 for Sun-Mon)

Data Focus:
- Emphasis on trip patterns and usage trends
- Privacy-conscious approach (removed personally identifiable information)
- Technical error mitigation through outlier detection
- Detailed analysis of user behavior patterns by type and time

"This cleaned dataset provides a robust foundation for analyzing bike-sharing patterns, focusing on usage patterns and temporal trends while maintaining data quality and user privacy."
